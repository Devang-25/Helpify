# COVID-19 2020 Global Hackathon

## Project Name: Helpify - Fighting Against the Invisible Enemy Together
## (Team Members: Devang Sharma, Shivay Lamba, Akash)

# Summary

(1) Helpify is a global location-based marketplace platform, where farmers, small retailers, and local delivery services, grouped by their location on the app's map, present the range of foodstuff to consumers. 

(2) We want to save time for our users to be able to see what the foodstuff is on sale nearby and can order pick-up or delivery. We want to provide small food retail and the family farms additional 'online-to-offline' sales channel. 

(3) We'll start by building customer's networking by direct marketing on the initial stage. We plan to turn then to local marketing with geo-targeted advertising and online marketing (SEO, SMM) on a more mature stage.
